# ReignDesignApp

For run this app you have to run the Podfile (in terminal, inside the route of the project, run the command: podfile install).
After that you will be able to open the file "ReignDesignApp.xcworkspace" (this file will appear after run the previous command).

The app it could be open in iPhone, iPod or iPad.
The app was maked only with code (nothing with interface builder) . I like to work this way because I have the whole control of the app behaviour
